# PRCO304ComputingProject
This is my Final year project for Plymouth University. The aim of the project was to create a mobile application that can successfully replace the current ordering process in place at fast food restaurants. Additionally, information collected and stored about customers would be used to produce recommendations for them using collaborative filtering.
### Technologies Used throughout this project:
• Java
